# How to Use
Download the installer from the Releases page of this Github

Run the installer

This will create a folder inside 
```bash
C:\Program Files\
```
Named BL3EditorHelper, inside that folder is the Shortcut and main EXE for the program, It should also put the Shortcut
to your Desktop or you can launch it by opening the Start Menu and searching for BL3EditorHelper

Once launched you can use the generic help command and then help $commandname to get more info on how the program works

When searching you don't need to know any file names just names of the items as they are in the files (a command to show items as they are named in files if they differ is included)
